Notify Vaccine
==============================

## Motivation
As we all know that our honourable government has announced that people you are above 18+ can now get vaccinated, which is a great news considering the spread of COVID-19. But, with such huge number of people trying to book their vaccine slots and vaccines being limited in quantity, it is very difficult to book the slots for the same.

So, make this python project to help everyone who is facing trouble in booking the slots.

## About
User can provide details regarding his slot booking and if there is a empty slot he is notified about it. Over that, if the user provides his email, he will get the email for the same. 


## Setup
Install the necessary python modules
Just run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## How to run the program

Just run python main.py 

#### to use email functionality
Enter your gmail id and password in creds.py file for the email function to work. also allow less secure apps from your gmail account settings.
